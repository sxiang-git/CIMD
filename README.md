About project CIMD Explained-"Cybersecurity in Medical Device Explained"

I once worked as a principal cybersecurity engineer and a principal software engineer on medical devices which were submitted for 510(k) clearance and PMA clearance with success, including:
-- Point-of-Care Instrument
-- Implantable-Pulse-Generator (IPG) Device 
-- Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Device

Through this open-source project, I'd like to share my experience of fulfilling the requirements by "Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions, Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff"
